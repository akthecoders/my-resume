I have solved many problems in my past experience with help of Data Structures and Design Patterns. I have an in-depth working experience in **ReactJS, PHP, NodeJs, Core Java, Deploying a system onto the cloud platform(Amazon and Google Cloud)**.

I possess strong **OOPs** concepts, which made me strong in **SOLID** Principles, which in turn has given me a great understanding of **Design Patterns**.
